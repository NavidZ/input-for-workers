      <p>In this specification  we propose an event delegation scheme to workers that assumes no DOM access in workers.
         This proposal introduces a generic event delegation mechanism that in theory works for all DOM events.
         However to be practical we intend to first focus on enabling this for input events starting with PointerEvents.
         This addresses key use cases and gives us a chance to prove and perfect the model while also leaving the door open
         to enable delegation for more event types that can benefit from this capability.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='intro' class='informative'>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>Today on the web platform only the main thread has access to the DOM elements and receives their related input events.
         In particular, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html">web workers</a> [[HTML]] and
         <a href="https://drafts.css-houdini.org/worklets/">worklets</a> do not have access to these.
         If we allow workers to receive input events for a given DOM node we enable many latency sensitive applications to leverage workers.
         As a result if developers want to do some event dependent logic like drawing on an off-screen canvas or using fetch in their worker thread
         they need to listen to those events on the main thread and postMessage them across to the worker thread.
         Here the worker is not only going to be blocked by the main thread to handle the events first but also suffers from the latency introduced by the extra thread hop.
         This is particularly unfortunate for the input events where the latency is important. The following sections outlines </p>

    <section dfn-for="EventDelegate">
      <h1>Event delegation and Interfaces</h1>

      <h2>Extensions to the <code>Element</code> interface</h2>
      <pre class="idl no-link-warnings">
partial interface Element {
    EventTarget createPassiveMirror();
};
      </pre>
      <dl data-dfn-for="Element" data-link-for="Element">
          <dt><dfn>createPassiveMirror</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Creates a cloneable <var>target</var> of type <code>EventTarget</code> from the <code>Element</code>.
              This <var>target</var> can be transferred to other workers using postMessage.
              When the <var>target</var> is created, its geometry is also sent to the agent that decides which event loop it should queue an event.
              If the event is targetted at <var>target</var> then the event must be queued in the event loop of the agent that has the ownership of
              the <var>target</var>.

    <section dfn-for="Dispatching a PointerEvent to the EventDelegate">
      <h1>Dispatching a PointerEvent to the EventDelegate</h1>
      <p>This section is a hook on <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dispatching-events">dispatch event algorithm</a> in [[!HTML]].
         User agent muse clone the dispatching event and stip all DOM refrences from it. Then it MUST fire that event at the <code>EventDelegate</code>.

  // Use event.clientX/Y or offsetX/Y to draw things on the context.
  context.beginPath();
  context.arc(event.offsetX, event.offsetY, 5, 0, 2.0* Math.PI, false);
  context.closePath();
